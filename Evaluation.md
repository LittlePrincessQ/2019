# Evaluation
I reviewed the possible places for traveling in winter. To evaluate each of them and compare ([Section 2](#Comparison)) the expectations, 
6 factors are considered as following:
* [Unique](#Unique): Is that unusual in other places/time (seasons)?
* [Safety](#Safety): Conditions should be safe.
* [Price](#Price): Cost should be acceptable.
* [Time](#Time): Time Period should be suitable.
* [Risk](#Risk): Probability to reach the expectation.
* [Comfort](#Comfort): Food/Accommodation/Transport.

## Unique
Is that unusual in other places/time (seasons)?

| Points | Cases |
| --- | --- |
| 1 pt | Common in other places&seasons |
| 2 pt | Common in other places, unusual in winter |
| 3 pt | Uncommon in other places, no better than other seasons |
| 5 pt | Uncommon in other places&seasons |

Note: The reason why "Place" is more important than "Time", is that visiting other places during appropriate seasons is better than revisiting this place in the future.
